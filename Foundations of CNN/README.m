# Convolutional Neural Networks: Step by Step

Welcome to Course 4's first assignment! In this assignment, you will implement convolutional (CONV) and pooling (POOL) layers in numpy, including both forward propagation and (optionally) backward propagation. 

By the end of this notebook, you'll be able to: 

* Explain the convolution operation
* Apply two different types of pooling operation
* Identify the components used in a convolutional neural network (padding, stride, filter, ...) and their purpose
* Build a convolutional neural network 

# Convolutional Neural Networks: Application

Welcome to Course 4's second assignment! In this notebook, you will:

- Create a mood classifer using the TF Keras Sequential API
- Build a ConvNet to identify sign language digits using the TF Keras Functional API

**After this assignment you will be able to:**

- Build and train a ConvNet in TensorFlow for a __binary__ classification problem
- Build and train a ConvNet in TensorFlow for a __multiclass__ classification problem
- Explain different use cases for the Sequential and Functional APIs
